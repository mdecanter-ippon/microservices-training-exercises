  # Gateway Tests 🌐

  These requests test the API Gateway routing functionality.
  All requests go through LocalStack API Gateway before reaching the services.

  **Purpose:**
  - Verify API Gateway routes correctly to each service
  - Test that path-based routing works (/users, /shipments, /orders)
  - Validate that security is enforced at the service level

  **Expected Results:**
  - ✅ Health checks: HTTP 200
  - ✅ OpenAPI specs: HTTP 200
  - ❌ Protected endpoints: HTTP 401 (until Step 5 with Keycloak)
